.TH BYZANZ-RECORD "1"
.SH NAME
byzanz-record \- record your desktop session to an animated GIF
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B byzanz-record
.RI [ options ] " FILENAME"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Byzanz records your desktop session to an animated GIF.  You can record your
entire screen, a single window, or an arbitrary region.  \fBbyzanz-record\fP
allows you to make recordings from the command line.  Graphical users may want
to use the panel applet instead.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Application Options:"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-audio\fR

supports it and will otherwise cause an error.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-duration\fR=\fISECS\fR
Duration of animation (default: 10 seconds)
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exec\fR=\fICOMMAND\fR
Instead of specifying the duration of the animation, execute the given \fBCOMMAND\fP
and record until the command exits. This is useful both for benchmarking and to
use more complex ways to stop the recording, like writing scripts that listen on
dbus.
.TP
\fB\-\-delay\fR=\fISECS\fR
Delay before start (default: 1 second)
.TP
\fB\-\-display\fR=\fIDISPLAY\fR

.SH OUTPUT FILE
After \fBbyzanz-record\fP is finished, the recording is written to FILENAME.
The format is determined by the filename extension. The following formats are
supported:
.TP
\fBbyzanz\fR
Record to Byzanz' internal debugging format. This is useful for benchmarking
Byzanz or if you want to convert the recording to multiple formats later.
You can use \fBbyzanz-playback\fP(1) to convert the file.
.TP
\fBflv\fR
Record to a Flash Screen video. This recording method is lossless. Use it if
you want to postprocess the file in other applications.
.TP
\fBgif\fR
Record to an animated GIF image. Use this if you want to record a mostly
static screen with a limited amount of colors, such as using a file manager
or an office application.
This is the default and will be used if an unrecognized extension is used.
.TP
\fBogg\fR, \fBogv\fR
Record to an Ogg Theora video. This format supports audio. Use this if you
want to record dynamic contents, such as video playback.
.TP
\fBwebm\fR
Record to a WebM video. This format consists of VP8 video and Vorbis audio
streams. Use this if you want to record dynamic contents, e.g. for a HTML5
video.
