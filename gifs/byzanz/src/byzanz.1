.SH NAME
byzanz \- small screencast creator
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBByzanz\fP is a small and efficient screencast creator. It records your
desktop session or parts of it to an animated GIF, OGG Theora or Flash.

Byzanz is implemented as a GNOME applet and can thus be used directly from any
panel which supports GNOME applets.

Furthermore it consists of two different tools, \fBbyzanz-record\fP, which
allows you to make recordings from the command line and
\fBbyzanz-playback\fP, which makes it possible to convert debug recordings
into other supported formats.
